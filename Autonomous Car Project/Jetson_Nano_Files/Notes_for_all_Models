IMPORTANT: Before training on the GPU cluster, make sure to rsync the myconfig file

The following trials have been done on the indoor track:
trial1 - first 20 laps done on original camera angle
trial2 - next set of data to optimize first 20

--- the above data sets and AI models kept swerving hard right, so the next trials were done with a less sharp camera angle (more range) ---

trial3 - first 20 laps on new camera angle
trial4 - updated model with more data - still shaky on several turns
trial5 - more data with clean laps. Model is kind of able to complete laps autonomously, with careful supervision on two sharp turns
ayush1 - trained data by ayush on 2.10
ayush2 - moved chairs and cones for more robust model

--- the combo AI models were taken by stitching together previous AI models

combo1 - combines trial3 and trial4
combo2 - combines trial5 with combo1, in other words, this model combines trial3, trial4, and trial5 AI model
combo3 - adds corner data to combo2 AI model
combo4 - combines ayush data sets with combo3

Current: combo2 is the culmination of all sets of good data. 
The turns to watch out for are the one in the back left corner and frontmost right corner of the tent.
The myconfig file is set to a low AI throttle speed of 0.72 to help the model make turns.

--- NEW WORKING MODEL FOR INDOOR TRACK ---

data and AI models both are named the following:
- indoor_new1 - this is the first 10-20 laps done
- indoor_new2 - focuses on corner difficulties

current working AI model is indoor_new2, and works at 0.90 throttle multiplier.
